# Task-7-SQL
Create an application that inserts,updates,deletes data in the database. Use PostgreSQL. Create a file with tables creation. Create a java application: on startup, it should run SQL script with tables creation from previously created files. If tables already exist - drop them. Generate test data: 10 groups with randomly generated names. The name should contain 2 characters, hyphen, 2 numbers, create 10 courses (math, biology, etc), 200 students. Take 20 first names and 20 last names and randomly combine them to generate students. Randomly assign students to groups. Each group could contain from 10 to 30 students. It is possible that some groups will be without students or students without groups. Create relation MANY-TO-MANY between tables STUDENTS and COURSES. Randomly assign from 1 to 3 courses for each student. Write SQL Queries, it should be available from the application menu: find all groups with less or equals student count, find all students related to course with given name, add new student, delete student by STUDENT_ID, add a student to the course (from a list), remove the student from one of his or her courses.
